# MERN
Find a Book

# Description

My goal was to make a create a website for the Avid book reader. It allows a reader to search for new books to read by author or title. Once they find the perfect book and add it to their list if they are signed up. If a user decides to sign up they will be able to add their favorite books to a list to remind them what to read next. they can either keep an evergrowing list of everything they have read or delete the book once they finish it. That way they are able to see what is next to read.

# Usage

This is a fully deployed website using [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/). Feel free to follow the link to my deployed site. To see everything I did behind the schenes you can copy the repo into VS Code. Once copied cd into the repo. From there Run `NPM run Install` to install all the dependecies. Once they are install Run `NPM run Build` to build the site. Once the site is build Run `NPM run Develop` to start the server. You will be able to follow the local serve routes in the terminal to see the client and server side 
   

# Credits
  
I used starter code given in the week 21 challenge as well as additional information provided in the OSU-VIRT-FSF-PT-08-2023-U-LOLC repo as a guideline on how to start this project. I also utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant and Stack over flow documents when additional information not provided in class was needed.
